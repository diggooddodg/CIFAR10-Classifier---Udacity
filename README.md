# Udacity Introduction to Machine Learning with PyTorch project: Create-your-own-image-classifier for CIFAR10
Purpose: To build an image classifier that will predict classes from a set of CIFAR10 images. This will be used to decide whether to build a model or use a commercially available model.  

All code appears in the Jupyter notebook including:  
* Data preparation  
* Model build using nn.functional  
* Model training, testing  
* Conclusion / recommendation

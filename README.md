# Udacity Introduction to Machine Learning with PyTorch project: Create-your-own-image-classifier for CIFAR10
Purpose: To build an image classifier that will predict image classes to determine if it wrthwhile proceeding with an in-house build vs. using a commercially available model  

All code appears in the Jupyter notebook including:  
*Data preparation  
*Model build using nn.functional  
*Model training, testing  
*Conclusion / recommendation
